In addition to the embedded video, IBMers and Business Partners can also download the recording from Seismic . Automation of nearly any infrastructure endpoint using minimal amounts of code has immense practical value to a world increasingly dependent on clouds operated by different vendors, in varying countries, across multiple premises. Implementation of modern automation solutions can likewise translate to a number of benefits for businesses of every size: reduced storage and resource burden placed on the machines to be automated; a much smaller footprint on these endpoints that could be hacked or exploited by malicious users; and most importantly, a greatly simplified approach to automation in general. As environments change and operating systems advance over time, the automation jobs underway and supported by these technologies can be easily modified in lockstep as well. Adaptability and extensibility are key ingredients in the longevity of any technology \u2014 and fortunately, the automation tooling for the hybrid multicloud era has those in abundance. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) commodifies the automation of everything else that applications, services, and containers need to run upon. That may include infrastructure provisioning, server deployments, IoT edge devices, script execution, and lots of other things that operations teams spend their time doing to \u201ckeep the lights on.\u201d AAP makes automation available to everyone with the lightest touch of human-readable snippets of code. TERMINOLOGY Ansible and AAP may be used interchangeably \u2014 and will be throughout the course of this lab work. Who uses AAP today? Many different and potentially siloed personas: IT Operators : These include automation administrators responsible for ensuring that the automation platform is available to developers and implementors upstream within the organization. These individuals are generally concerned with the uptime of the automation platform, as any interruptions to service availability can directly impact upstream users. Platform Developers : These individuals are the automation \"plumbers\" who ensure that endpoints are viable for automation. Tasks and responsibilities include maintaining the AAP modules, plugins, and the Roles (content) to be used by platform users. They are the domain experts that are coding up collections which can later be extended or consumed by the end-users of the automation jobs. Platform Users : These are the automation \"writers,\" stitching together each automation task\u2014 play by play, task by task \u2014using content generated by the Platform Developers within their Playbooks. Essentially, this is configuration management applied to the operations of IT estates. Instead of having a hardcoded script that instructs exactly how to move from task A to task B, you are creating a Playbook that lays out the expected end state and asks AAP to figure out the delta between the current and end state. But critically, AAP will not move on to task B until all of the conditions required by task A have been satisfied. This is not only invaluable for debugging purposes; it also guarantees a consistency and predictability to how AAP's automation tasks will be performed \u2014 something that you will come to keenly appreciate throughout this hands-on material, as we incrementally add more tasks and automation jobs to Playbooks for execution. Together, these qualities have two profound implications for AAP clients. First, it removes any ambiguity from the automation process: AAP will execute your instructions in exactly the order you\u2019ve assigned. Second, it places the burden of deciding how to achieve the end states of tasks A and B on the automation engine itself, rather than requiring the user to explicitly define all the gory details themselves. When automation is made available to everyone, it becomes possible to automate everything. The series of hands-on tutorials and learning modules embedded in this Level 3 course are designed to provide IBM Sellers, IBM Technical Sellers, and Business Partners with the fluency to gain trusted advisor status with clients and the expertise to tailor live technological demonstrations for customers. Throughout Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Level 3 for Sales and Technical Sales , you will utilize AAP in conjunction with IBM Power Systems infrastructure (PowerVC) to generate an IBM AIX-based virtual machine; subsequently, Ansible automation will be used to install and deploy a live WebSphere Application Server instance inside of the virtual machine. The various ways in which AAP's automation can also be applied to operational and administrative tasks\u2014 such as modifying root user characteristics, setting filesystem sizes, installing pre-requisites drivers and libraries, as well as software deployments \u2014will also be explored. All modules are accompanied by recordings and narrated instructions, delivered by your team of authors. It is strongly recommended that IBM Sellers and Technical Sellers watch these recordings, as they will be useful for you as you go about creating and recording your own Stand & Deliver presentations for Level 3 accreditation. LEVEL 3 ACCREDITATION To receive Level 3 accreditation, IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills learned throughout the various modules of these hands-on labs and coursework. Level 3 accreditation requirements\u2014 and the way in which participants will be evaluated before receiving accreditation \u2014differs depending on job role. Business Partners must pass an accreditation quiz after completing the hands-on portion of the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. IBM Sales and Technical Sales must develop and record a Stand & Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a \u201clive\u201d demo in front of a client \u2014 on camera. IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points that customer has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording must cover the seller\u2019s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client of the value of the IBM solution using the environments and techniques covered in this lab. Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand & Deliver recordings is provided within the documentation that accompanies the Level 3 course . LOOKING FOR COURSEWORK?

Welcome to the IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services hands-on demonstration, where sellers and business partners will have the opportunity to test the functionality of the Unified Key Orchestrator across IBM Cloud and AWS environments. IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services ( HPCS ) provides data encryption that\u2019s protected by a dedicated cloud hardware security module and enables multicloud key management. UKO, a component of HPCS, is what enables key orchestration across these multicloud environments. HPCS is built on FIPS 140-2 Level 4 certified hardware, the highest level in the industry. Unified Key Orchestrator ( UKO ) is a multi-cloud key management solution offered as a managed service on IBM Cloud. Built on \u2018Keep Your Own Key\u2019 (KYOK), UKO helps enterprises manage their data encryption keys over multiple key stores and across multiple clouds environments. These key environments include managed on-premises stores and keys on IBM Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure. UKO manages and orchestrates these security policies from a single point of control. BRING YOUR OWN KEY vs. KEEP YOUR OWN KEY How does the \"Keep Your Own Key\" (KYOK) approach of UKO differ from \"Bring Your Own Key\" (BYOK)? BYOK is a way for clients to use their own keys to encrypt data. Key management services that provide BYOK are typically multi-tenant services. With these services, users can import encryption keys from on-premises hardware security modules (HSM) and then manage the keys. KYOK includes all of the capabilities of BYOK, but also provides technical assurances that IBM cannot access a client's keys. With KYOK, clients have exclusive control of the entire key hierarchy, including that of the master key. The following table provides further details on the differences between BYOK and KYOK: Key benefits to HPCS clients Lifecycle management for keys : A GUI and a REST API track keys as they progress. Deleted data is no longer retrievable, regardless of the application that stored it. Learn more. Encryption for IBM Cloud services : IBM Cloud services can integrate with this product. Clients receive a common-key-provider API for a consistent approach in IBM Cloud adoption. Learn more. Multicloud key management : Extend protection across cloud deployments. Manage all keys in one place, with added protection and simplicity. Learn more. Security certification : The service is built on FIPS 140-2 Level-4-certified hardware\u2014the highest offered by any cloud provider in the industry. Learn more. HSM control : Single-tenant, dedicated HSMs are controlled by you. IBM Cloud administrators have no access. Learn more. Key ceremony : IBM is the first to provide cloud command-line interface (smart cards) for the HSM key ceremony. Learn more.

The recommended amount is 2 days, although it is possible to finish the hands-on demonstration within a few hours. When satisfied, verify that you agree to the Terms and Conditions for the environment and finalize your reservation request by clicking Submit . Reservations take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete from the time that you click submit. If you navigate to the My Reservations tab of the ITZ, you can monitor the progress of your reservation. WAIT UNTIL READY Wait for the ITZ reservation to be marked as \" Ready \" before attempting to start the lab \u2014 accessing it too soon will lead to issues (or an outright failure) when connecting to the HPCS instance. You will also receive an email to your inbox once the environment has successfully deployed. The \"Your environment is ready\" email contains links back to the My Reservations tab, which now is populated with all of the details needed to access your IBM Cloud HPCS environment. Repeat the same reservation Steps 2 through 6 for the AWS Account Access instance. You will need to wait for both instances (IBM HPCS and AWS) to finish provisioning through the My Reservations tab of the ITZ before continuing with the lab. Accessing the HPCS and AWS environments For the IBM Cloud HPCS environment, you will receive an email (see Step 6) with an invitation to connect your personal IBM Cloud account to an ITZ V2 account, as shown in the following screenshot. You must ACCEPT the invitation by clicking the Join Now button in the email. A web browser will open and direct you to log in to your IBM Cloud account. Proceed and then accept the ITZ V2 invitation when prompted to do so. Once authenticated and logged in, look for a drop-down in the top-right corner of the IBM Cloud interface and click it to toggle between different Organizations / Resource Groups. You should see ITZ V2 listed, potentially alongside multiple others. Click the ITZ V2 group and wait for the browser to refresh. From the left-hand interface, click the Resource List icon (three stacked and bulleted lines) and drill down in the Security row. You should see an HPCS instance similar to the one shown in the following screenshot. For retrieving the AWS Account Access that was requested in Step 7, return to your email inbox and look for an email stating that the AWS environment is ready (similar to the screenshot provided below). Record the AWS Access Group , AWS SSO User Portal URL , and Desktop details provided in the note. Alternatively, you can always retrieve this information from the My Reservations tab of the ITZ. Click the Desktop link in the email or navigate to https://techzone.awsapps.com/start to get started. When prompted, authenticate using your personal IBMid to continue to the AWS dashboard, as shown below. Click on the AWS Account (1) tile and drill down into the UKO User Management Console , which will redirect the web browser to a page resembling the following screenshot. Under the Console Home panel, multiple links are provided: Key Management Service , IAM , AWS Budgets , AWS Organizations , and so on. Select the Key Management Service link. From the drop-down in the top-right corner of the AWS dashboard, ensure that the US East (N. Virginia) region is selected. It should be set as such by default, but if it has been configured to something else, set it back to US East.","title":"Provision and access an IBM Technology Zone environment"},{"location":"HPCS/02%20Provision%20and%20access/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"HPCS/02%20Provision%20and%20access/#provisioning-an-ibm-technology-zone-environment","text":"IBM TECHNOLOGY ZONE You will require access to the IBM Technology Zone in order to reserve your environment and complete the hands-on training.
